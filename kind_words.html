                Carisa and her team went above and beyond to make my daughter’s wedding day FLAWLESS. From our very first phone call, I felt my burdens lift and felt assured by her confidence, knowledge and experience that she and her team would orchestrate a successful wedding. It was, by far, the best money we spent! I was able to feel relaxed and truly enjoy the full day, knowing Carisa had everything under control and was steering the ship. They thought of every detail and made everything feel personal. It was amazing to not have to worry about setting anything up or taking anything down after the event. We were able to visit with our guests and relish this memorable day without worrying about anything. That is priceless! Carisa and her team were so positive, optimistic, cheerful and kind… they were truly a pleasure to work with and we feel so fortunate to have been able to hire them. I recommend them without any hesitation. Truly TOP NOTCH!

                When I decided to have a destination wedding, I was nervous because I wouldn’t be present and would have to rely on someone else. I was immediately impressed with Carisa when I met her and knew she would ease my mind. She had awesome attention to detail and was so responsive. I told her my wedding ideas, and she worked hard to bring them life. All of my guests were so impressed with our wedding, from the ceremony to the reception venue – even the bus tour of Portland! If you want a planner who listens to and executes your ideas perfectly then Carisa is your person!

                Carisa is the absolute best. For real. She and her team at Adornment Events have superb attitudes and abilities. My wedding would have been a disaster without them. It POURED down rain, and Carisa did not bat an eye. Her team were prepared and had anticipated what they would need to do for the wedding to go off without a hitch, which it did. Choosing Adornment Events was the best decision about the entire wedding, apart from my bride choosing me. Carisa was highly communicative, efficient, and a pleasure to have pioneering the organization and structure of our ceremony and reception. If I could give 11/5 stars, I would. I simply cannot sing the praises of Adornment Events enough. If you are even questioning in the slightest about who you should select for your wedding coordination needs, look no further, you have found the premiere coordinating company in the greater Portland area.

                I cannot speak any more highly of Carisa and the Adornment Events team. When I say our wedding day was executed with no problems – I truly mean it! We had the most perfect day, and absolutely everything was taken care of. I wish I could do it all over again just to have more time to hang out with the adornment team and their vendors! Truly the best addition to the wedding and I could not imagine doing it without them. 10/10 would recommend to anyone and everyone!
